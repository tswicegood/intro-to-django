# Intro to Django
This talk introduces the attendee to Django.  It's meant as a broad overview of the key concepts that power a Django application.  It covers:

* Minimum Settings
* Models
* Admin
* Routing, Views, and Templates
* Brief Tour of the Ecosystem

Any of these topics warrants a full talk by itself.  This talk attempts to compress them down into their essentials and is meant to be done in less than one hour.
